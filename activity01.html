2. Explain the history of the internet from web 1.0 to web 3.0. explain in 4 to 8 sentences.<br>
3. Is a wordpress "developer" a developer? explain in 3 to 5 sentences.<br></p>
 <p>Answers:<br>
 1. I currently want to learn about both, and would like to continue to understand them, so I'd know soon enough what kind of developer I want to be. 
  Front-end developer looks cool to me, so I may lean more toward it, since I've already gotten experience in HTML webpage making. 
  But I'd also like to learn about back-end development, and search for what I would like to do among the two, and actually find it. 
 I'm still quite new to these concepts, so it would be preferable if I would be given some patience as I continue to learn.</p>
